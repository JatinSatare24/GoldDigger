# Gold Digger 💰

**Gold Digger** is a full-stack financial tracking application designed to monitor gold prices specifically for the Indian market. Built as a solo project for the Scrimba curriculum, it demonstrates a mastery of the request-response lifecycle by delivering real-time (simulated) market data through a custom-built Node.js architecture.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Indian Market Price Tracking**: Specialized logic to fetch and display gold prices per gram, tailored to current Indian market fluctuations.
* **Dynamic Price Generation**: Implements a backend algorithm to simulate live market volatility by fetching randomized per-gram price data.
* **Custom Static Server**: A hand-coded file-serving utility that manages HTML, CSS, and JS assets with precise MIME type handling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Node.js (Core `http` module) — strictly no frameworks to showcase deep technical understanding.
* **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), and Semantic HTML5.
* **Asynchronous I/O**: `fs/promises` for non-blocking data persistence.
